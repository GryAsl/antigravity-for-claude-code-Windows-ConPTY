# Troubleshooting

Symptom-first guide to every problem reported so far. **Start by running `agy-doctor`**
(or `/antigravity:setup` inside Claude Code) — it diagnoses most of the below and prints
the plugin version, agy version/auth state, and platform warnings.

---

## "`/scripts/agy-delegate.sh: No such file or directory`" or `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is empty

**Cause:** you're on a plugin version < 0.14.0. `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is only substituted
inside structured config (hooks/MCP) — it is **not** exported to the shell commands the
model runs, so marketplace installs saw an empty path ([#11](https://github.com/yuting0624/antigravity-for-claude-code/issues/11),
[#15](https://github.com/yuting0624/antigravity-for-claude-code/issues/15)).

**Fix:** update — since 0.14.0 everything is invoked by bare names (`agy-delegate`,
`agy-job`, `agy-doctor`, `agy-cost-compare`) on the plugin's `bin/` PATH:

```
/plugin marketplace update antigravity-for-claude-code-windows-conpty
/reload-plugins
```

---

## Windows: ConPTY setup, missing bridge, or timeout

**Cause (upstream, not the plugin):** on native Windows, headless `agy` needs a real
console (ConPTY). When the plugin runs it as a child process with redirected stdio there
is no console, and agy v1.0.x can hard-hang before producing any output
([#6](https://github.com/yuting0624/antigravity-for-claude-code/issues/6)).

**"But agy works when I type it in my terminal!"** — yes: typed directly, agy has a real
console (interactive mode). Invoked by the plugin, it runs headless (no console). That's
the difference, not Windows vs the plugin.

This fork fixes that launch path by running agy in a fresh Windows ConPTY through the
unchanged `agy-headless-bridge` PyPI package. WSL is optional, not required.

```powershell
agy                                      # authenticate interactively once
py -3 -m pip install -U agy-headless-bridge
```

Then run `agy-doctor` or `/antigravity:setup`.

| symptom | fix |
|---|---|
| exit 16 / bridge package missing | `py -3 -m pip install -U agy-headless-bridge` |
| package is installed but doctor cannot import it | it is in a different interpreter; set `AGY_BRIDGE_PYTHON` to that `python.exe`, or install with the interpreter doctor prints |
| `No module named winpty` / ConPTY backend failure | `py -3 -m pip install -U --force-reinstall pywinpty agy-headless-bridge` |
| `agy` not found (exit 13) | put `agy.exe` on PATH or set `AGY_PATH` to its full path |
| auth required (exit 11) | run `agy` once in a real terminal and finish sign-in |
| model unavailable (exit 14) | check models interactively and remap `tier_flash`, `tier_flash_lo`, or `tier_pro` |
| idle/hard timeout (exit 12) | one idle result is not proof of lost connectivity; run a short `/model` or one-file probe, then narrow/split the task or raise `--timeout` / `--idle-timeout` |

`AGY_BRIDGE_PYTHON` must be an executable path, not a shell command string. The default
is `py -3`, then a working `python` fallback. `agy-doctor` reports the exact interpreter
and bridge version it resolved.

Structured print mode can stay completely silent while Gemini is still searching and
reasoning. Older builds used a fixed 120-second ConPTY idle timeout, so a broad repository
scout could be killed even when its 5- or 10-minute hard timeout had not expired. Current
builds derive the idle timeout just above the hard ceiling by default. You may override it
with `agy-delegate --idle-timeout <seconds>`, plugin option `idle_timeout`, or environment
variable `AGY_BRIDGE_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (highest non-CLI precedence). A deliberately smaller
idle value is useful for detecting a true stall, but can recreate the false positive.

Diagnose an `idle (no output)` result before falling back to Claude:

```bash
agy-delegate --tier flash --dir . --timeout 45s --digest \
  "READ-ONLY health probe: report one existing source filename; change nothing."
```

If that succeeds, auth/model/bridge/workspace reads are healthy. Split the original
omnibus prompt into independent scouts or retry it once with a suitable hard timeout.
Only treat the bridge as unavailable when the small probe or bounded retry also fails.

## Everything hangs forever, and `/antigravity:setup` says the CLI is broken

**Symptom:** `agy models` and every delegation never return. `agy-doctor` reports a hung or
unauthenticated CLI — but typing `agy models` yourself works fine. macOS and Linux, not just
Windows.

**Cause:** you have **stdio MCP servers configured** and a plugin build older than 0.22.1
([#37](https://github.com/yuting0624/antigravity-for-claude-code/issues/37)). agy's stdio MCP
children **inherit its stdout and outlive agy**. A shell command substitution only returns
once *every* holder of the pipe's write end closes it, so `OUT="$(agy ...)"` waits forever on
children that are still alive. The wall-clock guard cannot rescue this: `timeout` kills
`agy`, not the grandchildren.

The one-line test, from the original report — same machine, only the config changed:

```bash
# stdout to a FILE — returns in ~6s
timeout 60 agy -p "Reply with exactly: PONG" > /tmp/out.txt 2>/dev/null </dev/null

# stdout to a PIPE (what the wrappers used to do) — hangs
timeout 90 bash -c 'O="$(timeout 60 agy -p "Reply with exactly: PONG" 2>/dev/null)"' </dev/null
```

**Fix: update to 0.22.1 or later.** agy's stdout now goes to a temp file, which children
inherit harmlessly. Check with `agy-doctor` (it prints the plugin version).

### It still hangs on 0.22.1+

Then it is a **different mechanism**, and one the plugin cannot fix: agy waits on its MCP
servers at startup, so a server that never finishes connecting blocks `agy` itself — this
reproduces even with stdout on a file. `agy-doctor` now tells you how many stdio MCP servers
you have when `agy models` times out.

To confirm, check agy's log (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/log/cli-*.log`) for a server that
never reports ready, or move `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` aside temporarily. Note agy
loads MCP servers from **two** places — that file and `~/.gemini/config/plugins/*/mcp_config.json`.

## WSL: delegation works but is absurdly slow (20s+ for trivial calls)

**Cause:** your repo lives on a Windows mount (`/mnt/c/...`). agy reads `--dir` workspaces
over WSL's 9p bridge, which is ~10x slower than native FS.

**Fix:** move the repo into the WSL Linux filesystem (e.g. `~/projects/...`). Both the
wrapper and `agy-doctor` warn when they detect this.

---

## agy says "done" but wrote no files (or wrote them somewhere else)

**Cause:** write tasks need write permission, and headless agy's no-permission behavior
has changed across versions. **Your workspace stays untouched every time**; what varies is
whether the run admits it ([#10](https://github.com/yuting0624/antigravity-for-claude-code/issues/10)):
- pre-1.1.0: only *describes* the edits
- 1.1.0–1.1.2: writes to its **own scratch dir** (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/scratch/`)
- 1.1.3–1.1.1x: **soft-denies** — rc 0, empty stdout, a stderr notice naming the allow-rule
- by **1.1.13**: **hard error** — the run fails (rc 1) with `permission check failed for
  write_file "...": user denied permission for write_file(...)`. Same cause, different
  shape, and none of the older wording. The wrapper classifies both as **exit 15**; a
  plugin before 0.24.0 reports the hard one as a bare `agy exited 1` instead

**Fix:**
- **For a file write, add an allow-rule — the narrower fix.** In
  `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`, under `permissions.allow`, add
  `write_file(<dir>)`. It matches **recursively beneath `<dir>`** and needs no flag.
  This is the rule agy's own denial message is naming. Confirmed on agy 1.1.9 by a
  controlled A/B ([#37](https://github.com/yuting0624/antigravity-for-claude-code/issues/37));
  a glob form (`write_file(/path/**)`) was reported *not* to match.
  **Substitute a real path for `<dir>`** — and if the rule is in place and the write is
  *still* denied, suspect the rule before suspecting agy. An entry agy cannot parse
  grants nothing on any version, which is exactly this exit 15 with the rule sitting
  right there in the file. Only one shape of mistake is version-sensitive, and it is not
  this one: a `command(...)` rule naming no command — `command(time)`, a comment-only
  entry, `()` — matched **every** command before **1.1.11** and silently auto-approved
  anything the agent ran. Run `agy-doctor`: it validates each entry and reports the
  consequence that actually applies to yours.
- **Or pass `--yolo`** (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) — works across all agy versions,
  but auto-approves **all** tools, not just the write. Required anyway for web / Vertex AI
  Search / terminal when no rule covers them. (`--mode accept-edits` is NOT a headless write grant. Measured on agy 1.1.13 — where the flag is actually applied, since 1.1.12 fixed `--mode` being ignored in headless `-p` entirely — the write is denied exactly like one without it. Earlier notes here said "soft-denied on 1.1.3"; on a build where the flag was never applied, that observation could not tell a denial apart from the flag doing nothing.)
- Claude Code may prompt for (or in auto-mode, block) `--dangerously-skip-permissions` —
  approve it, or pre-allow `Bash(agy-delegate*)` in your permission settings.
- Run write tasks on a **dedicated branch**. `--sandbox` is *not* containment: Measured on macOS with agy 1.1.19: with `--yolo`, `--sandbox` changed nothing — a write to an absolute path OUTSIDE `--dir` succeeded (rc 0), `id` ran and returned a real uid, and `curl https://example.com` returned 200. agy's own help says "terminal restrictions"; whatever it restricts, it is not those, and not in this combination. Not tested on Linux.
- **Always verify files actually changed in your workspace** (`git status`) — never trust
  the self-report. The wrapper maps BOTH denial shapes — the 1.1.3 soft-deny and the
  1.1.13 hard error — to **exit 15**, so you get an actionable message instead of a
  bare "empty output" or "agy exited 1".
- Long write tasks can exceed Claude Code's ~2-min synchronous Bash limit → run them as a
  background job: `ID=$(agy-job start --tier pro --dir . "<task>")`, then
  `/antigravity:status` / `/antigravity:result <id>` (interactive sessions only).

## Exit codes & `AGY_SIGNAL`

On classifiable failures the wrapper prints a machine-readable line to stderr:
`AGY_SIGNAL {"status":"...","reason":"...","model":"...","retry":"..."}`

| exit | meaning | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | success | — |
| 1 | usage error | check flags (`agy-delegate --help`) |
| 2 | agy failed (unclassified) | read the stderr it relayed |
| 3 | agy returned empty output | retry; check model availability (`agy models`) |
| 10 | quota / rate limit | wait, then resume the same conversation with `--continue` |
| 11 | not authenticated | run `agy` once interactively to sign in |
| 12 | timeout (agy's own, or the wall-clock guard) | raise `--timeout`, narrow the task; on Windows see the hang section above |
| 13 | agy not on PATH | install the Antigravity CLI |
| 14 | model unavailable | the `--model` / `tier_*` / `default_model` name isn't in `agy models` (agy ≥ 1.1.2 hard-fails instead of silently downgrading) — run `agy models` and fix the name |
| 15 | permission denied | a tool needed permission headless — **both** shapes: agy 1.1.3's soft deny (rc 0, empty stdout) and 1.1.13's hard error (`user denied permission`). Add a `permissions.allow` rule covering the target, or pass `--yolo`; run on a branch |
| 16 | bridge/Python unavailable (`agy-delegate` on Windows), or python3 missing (`agy-migrate`) | run `agy-doctor`; install the bridge with the reported interpreter, or install python3 for migration |
| 17 | one or more migration steps failed (`agy-migrate` only) | read the named steps; the run is still revertible with `agy-migrate --uninstall --apply` |
| 18 | prerequisite missing (`agy-migrate` only) | no Claude Code config dir, or agy has never been run |

## "tier model not in `agy models`" warning from doctor

**Cause:** agy's model list is plan-dependent (Vertex plans are Gemini-only; some plans
expose Claude/GPT). The default tier mappings may not match your plan.

**Fix:** remap tiers to models you actually have — plugin options `tier_flash` /
`tier_flash_lo` / `tier_pro` or `default_model` (exact names from `agy models`), or pass
`--model "<exact name>"` per call.

---

## Output is huge / "looks like a raw dump, not a digest"

**Cause:** the wrapper warns (stderr) when a reply exceeds `digest_warn_chars` (default
8000). Ingesting raw dumps into the conductor's context is where the cost savings die.

**Fix:** re-run with `--digest` (appends a digest-only output contract to the prompt), or
have agy summarize before you ingest. Tune the threshold via the `digest_warn_chars`
plugin option; `0` disables the warning.

---

## Updating / checking your version

Third-party marketplace plugins do **not** auto-update by default:

```
/plugin marketplace update antigravity-for-claude-code-windows-conpty
/reload-plugins
```

`agy-doctor` prints the installed plugin version (last line of its checks). Fixes land as
version bumps — see [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).
